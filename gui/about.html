        <h1>Project by: Jaxon Singleton & Ethan Wenthe</h1>
        <h2>Use Case: We desired to design an application were users are able to seek out topic and representitives
            currently in congress to better their understanding of who they are voting for.</h2>
        <h2>Structure: To achieve this the application pulls congressional bills from the House and the Senate using
            Congress.api and enacted a bm25 algorithm to return relevant bills based on the topic asked. The returns
            will also reveil the votes of representitives, to better fit the use case of this application. </h2>
