  <summary date="2015-09-11T16:12:46Z" status="Passed House without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Declares that:

 the President has not complied with provisions of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 requiring transmission to Congress of nuclear agreements with Iran and related verification assessments because the communication from the President did not constitute the agreement as defined by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954; and the period for review by Congress of nuclear agreements with Iran under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 has not commenced because the agreement has not yet been transmitted to the appropriate congressional committees and leadership.</summary>
