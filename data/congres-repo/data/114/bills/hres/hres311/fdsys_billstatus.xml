        <text><![CDATA[ <p>Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that, in order to overturn the Supreme Court decision in: (1) <em>Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</em>, Congress should enact and the states should ratify a constitutional amendment providing that any right of a corporation, other business organization, or other artificial entity to engage in political activity, including making contributions and expenditures to influence an election for public office or a ballot measure, is not derived from the First Amendment but from the laws of the United States and the states and may be exercised only to the extent provided by such laws; and (2) <em>Buckley v. Valeo</em>, Congress should enact and the states should ratify a constitutional amendment providing that Congress and the states have the authority to impose limits on the amount of expenditures that may be made by candidates and others in support of elections for public office.</p>]]></text>
