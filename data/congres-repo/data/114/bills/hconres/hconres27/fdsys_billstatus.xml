        <description>An amendment numbered 2 printed in House Report 114-49 to make investments in education, job training, transportation and infrastructure, and advanced research and development programs that will help the economic recovery. It includes funding for a comprehensive jobs bill and targeted investments to reduce the poverty in America. The CBC budget protects the social safety net without cutting Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, or SNAP. It raises new revenue by making our tax system fairer, saving more than $1.9 trillion on the deficit over the next decade and reduces the annual budget deficit to 2.3% of GDP by FY 2025.</description>
        <purpose>Amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in House Report 114-49 and numbered 2 was offered as the Congressional Black Caucus substitute.</purpose>
