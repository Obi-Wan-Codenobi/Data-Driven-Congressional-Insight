This bill declares that a workplace wellness program, by offering a reward to participants, does not violate the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 or title I or II of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 if the program complies with Public Health Service Act requirements.

Collection of information about a family member's manifested disease or disorder is not considered an unlawful acquisition of genetic information with respect to another family member participating in a workplace wellness program.

This bill takes effect as if enacted on March 23, 2010.</summary>
