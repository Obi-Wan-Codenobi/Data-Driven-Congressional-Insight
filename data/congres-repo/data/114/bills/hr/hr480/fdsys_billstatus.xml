        <text><![CDATA[ <p><strong>Housing America's Workforce Act of 2015</strong> </p> <p> Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow employers a business-related tax credit for up to 50% (100% for small business employers) of the qualified housing expenses paid for the benefit of their employees. Defines &quot;qualified housing expenses&quot; to include homeownership assistance and rental assistance. Limits the amount of such credit to the lesser of $10,000 or 6% of an employee's home purchase price, or up to $5,000 for rental assistance. Excludes from employee gross income the value of employer-paid housing assistance.</p> <p>Authorizes the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to award grants in FY2015-FY2017, on a competitive basis, to nonprofit housing organizations or local governments for certain costs, including operating costs and technical assistance costs, of employer-assisted housing programs. Requires the Secretary to establish a national clearinghouse, including a website, to provide information about employer-assisted housing programs to federal, state, and local governments and other interested entities. </p> <p>Directs the Comptroller General to conduct a study of employer-assisted housing programs and provide the Secretary with an interim report by January 1, 2018, and final report by December 31, 2019. </p>]]></text>
