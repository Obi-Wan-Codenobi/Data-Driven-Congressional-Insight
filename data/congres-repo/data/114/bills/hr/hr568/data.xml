This bill directs the Department of Energy to submit a report within one year on the impact of thermal insulation on both energy and water use systems for potable hot and chilled water in federal buildings and on the return on investment of installing the insulation. The report must include: (1) an analysis based on the cost of municipal or regional water for delivered water and the avoided cost of new water; and (2) a summary of energy and water savings, including short-term and long-term (20 years) projections of such savings.</summary>
