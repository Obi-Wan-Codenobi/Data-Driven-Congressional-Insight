  <summary date="2016-08-26T19:09:09Z" status="Introduced in House">FEMA Disaster Assistance Reform Act of 2015

Authorizes appropriations for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for FY2016-FY2018 for management and administration.

 Directs FEMA, through the National Advisory Council, to undertake and report on a comprehensive study of disaster costs and losses.

 Amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to:

 authorize through FY2018 the NationalUrban Search and Rescue Response System and grants to implement the Emergency Management Assistance Compact; include public broadcasting facilities within the definition of "private nonprofit facility" for purposes of disaster assistance eligibility; establish a three-year statute of limitation for reclaiming disaster relief funds and for collecting debts related to disaster assistance; allow a waiver for the collection of certain disaster-related debts; increase the threshold for determining the eligibility of certain small projects for expedited disaster assistance payments; establish rates for reimbursing states and local governments for direct and indirect administrative costs incurred to implement disaster recovery projects; authorize the President, whether or not a major disaster is declared, to provide hazard mitigation assistance in any area affected by a fire; and allow recipients of hazard mitigation assistance to use such assistance for activities to reduce the risk of future damage, hardship, loss, or suffering in any area affected by a wildfire or earthquake hazards. Directs FEMA to: (1) study and report on physical testing standards for electric utility facilities, (2) report to specified congressional committees on agency plans to provide guidance to applicants for disaster assistance on FEMA disaster funding procedures and to maintain appropriate records during the lifecycle of a disaster, and (3) identify in its report new technologies to assist the disaster workforce during a disaster or emergency.</summary>
