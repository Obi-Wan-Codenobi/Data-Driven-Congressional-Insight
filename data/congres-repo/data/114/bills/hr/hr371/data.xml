This bill amends the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to allow catastrophic plans to be offered as qualified health plans to any individual in the individual or group market. (Qualified health plans are sold on health insurance exchanges, are eligible for premium subsidies, and fulfill an individual's requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage.) Currently, to be a qualified health plan, a catastrophic plan must enroll only individuals who are below age 30 and exempt from minimum essential coverage requirements.</summary>
