  <summary date="2016-04-27T20:16:31Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to direct the Environmental Protection Agency to develop and submit to Congress a strategic plan for assessing and managing risks associated with drought to drinking water provided by public water systems.

The plan must include steps and time lines to:

 evaluate the risks posed by drought to drinking water provided by public water systems; establish a comprehensive list of the effects of drought on drinking water that may have an adverse effect on human health; summarize the known adverse human health effects, factors that cause drought, and factors that exacerbate the effects of drought on drinking water provided by public water systems; determine whether to establish guidance for quantifying the effects of drought on drinking water and for determining the frequency of monitoring necessary to detect the effects; recommend feasible treatment options to mitigate such effects, including procedures, equipment, and source water protection practices; and enter into cooperative agreements with, and provide technical assistance to, affected states and public water systems to manage risks associated with the effects of drought on drinking water.</summary>
