  <summary date="2015-03-27T20:13:16Z" status="Introduced in House">Synthetic Abuse and Labeling of Toxic Substances Act of 2015 or the SALTS Act

Amends the Controlled Substances Act to authorize the following factors to be considered in determining whether a controlled substance analogue was intended for human consumption:

 the marketing, advertising, and labeling of the substance; the known efficacy or usefulness of the substance for the marketed, advertised, or labeled purpose; the difference between the price at which the substance is sold and the price at which the substance it is purported to be or advertised as is normally sold; the diversion of the substance from legitimate channels and the clandestine importation, manufacture, or distribution of the substance; whether the defendant knew or should have known that the substance was intended to be consumed by injection, inhalation, ingestion, or any other immediate means; and whether the substance is manufactured, formulated, sold, distributed, or marketed with the intent to avoid the provisions of existing drug laws. Declares that evidence that a substance was not marketed, advertised, or labeled for human consumption shall not by itself be sufficient to establish that the substance was not intended for human consumption.</summary>
