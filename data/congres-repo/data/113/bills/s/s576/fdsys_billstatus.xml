        <text><![CDATA[ <p>Small Public Housing Agency Opportunity Act of 2013 - Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to subject a small public housing agency (PHA) to the same requirements as a PHA.</p> <p>Defines a small PHA as a PHA for which the sum of the number of public housing dwelling units and the number of vouchers under Section 8 (tenant-based assistance) it administers is 550 or fewer.</p> <p>Requires the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to:</p> <ul> <li>provide for physical inspections of a small PHA public housing project at least once every three years, unless it is a troubled small PHA;</li> <li>determine the financial condition of a small PHA's public housing program solely on the basis of the ratio of current assets to current liabilities; and </li> <li>determine management condition of a small PHA's public housing program solely on the basis of the ratio of vacant unit months to eligible unit months.</li> </ul> <p>Requires a small PHA administering Section 8 tenant-based assistance under the housing voucher program to make physical inspections of assisted units at least once every three years.</p> <p>Requires HUD to evaluate the management of a small PHA's voucher program solely on the basis of its lease-up rate or the budget utilization rate.</p> <p>Directs HUD to designate a small PHA as a high-performing agency if it exceeds acceptability criteria.</p> <p>Specifies conditions under which HUD may designate a small PHA as a troubled small PHA with respect to its public housing program or housing voucher program.</p> <p>Requires HUD to establish an appeals process for a small PHA to dispute a determination of deficiency.</p> <p>Requires HUD and the small PHA to enter into a one-year corrective action agreement (renewable at HUD option) under which the small PHA shall undertake actions to correct deficiencies.</p> <p>Prescribes and/or revises requirements to reduce the administrative burden on small PHAs with respect to:</p> <ul> <li>certain reports;</li> <li>community service;</li> <li>economic opportunities for low- and very low-income persons;</li> <li>exemption of a small PHA administering not more than 400 public housing dwelling units, upon request, from any asset management requirement;</li> <li>exemption from environmental review for a development or modernization project with a total cost of not more than $100,000; and </li> <li>streamlined HUD procedures for such reviews. </li> </ul> <p>Authorizes a small PHA to convert all or a portion of its public housing units to project-based voucher assistance or to project-based assistance.</p> <p>Requires HUD to carry out a demonstration project to examine how various methods of determining rent in public housing affect the administrative burden on small PHAs and public housing residents.</p> <p>Establishes rent-setting mechanisms for demonstration project participants based on: (1) a tiered system for initial rents for extremely low-income families, very low-income families, and low-income families; (2) a certain range of gross income percentages; or (3) one or more of these methods in combination with methods established for assisted housing rental payments.</p> <p>Authorizes a small PHA to elect to be paid for its utility and waste management costs under the formula for a period, at its discretion, of up to 20 years based on its average annual consumption during the three-year period preceding the year in which the election is made.</p> <p>Requires HUD to develop and deploy all electronic information systems necessary to accommodate full consolidated reporting by PHAs electing to operate in consortia.</p>]]></text>
