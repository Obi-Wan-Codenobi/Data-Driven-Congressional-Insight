        <text><![CDATA[ <p>Prepaid Card Disclosure Act of 2014 - Amends the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to extend its coverage to spending accounts (transaction accounts) established by a consumer (or on a consumer's behalf) at an insured depository institution or credit union: (1) to which recurring electronic fund transfers may be made, at the consumer's direction; or (2) from which payments may be made, at the consumer's direction, through the use of a card, code, or device (commonly referred to as prepaid cards). Treats as a spending account any similar transaction account operated or managed by a financial institution, or any other person, whose funds: (1) are pooled with the funds of a person other than the one who established the account, or (2) are held in a name other than that of the person who established the account.</p> <p>Excludes from the meaning of spending account: (1) any nonreloadable general-use prepaid card in an amount under $250; (2) any general-use prepaid card solely associated with a certain kind of health plan, a qualified transportation fringe, a health savings account or any other health care benefit account; (3) a gift certificate; (4) a store gift card; (5) an electronic promise, plastic card, or payment code, or device; (6) a nonreloadable card labeled as a gift card and marketed solely as such; (7) a nonreloadable loyalty, rebate, or promotional card; or (8) a debit card or general-use prepaid card that has been provided to a person pursuant to a federal, state or local government-administered payment program, in which the person may only use the card to transfer or debit funds, monetary value, or other assets that have been provided pursuant to that program.</p> <p>Authorizes the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to require the placement of a QR code, barcode, or other similar technology on any packaging, card, or other object associated with a spending account, provided that the technology is capable of providing an electronic link to certain required disclosures to the consumer.</p>]]></text>
