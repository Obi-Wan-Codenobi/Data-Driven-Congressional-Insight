        <text><![CDATA[ <p>Alternative Fueled Vehicles Competitiveness and Energy Security Act of 2013 - Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to expand the list of technology categories that are eligible for loan guarantees by including a category for infrastructure for provision and distribution of alternative fuels. </p> <p>Amends the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to: (1) redefine "advanced technology vehicle," for purposes of the advanced technology vehicles manufacturing incentive program, to include certain vehicles that will reduce consumption of conventional motor fuel by 25% or more compared to existing surface transportation technologies that perform a similar function; (2) repeal the limit on the amount of appropriations that may be used for direct loans under such program; and (3) extend funding through FY2018 for such program.</p> <p>Directs the Secretary to: (1) assess the effectiveness of alternative fuel and alternative fueled vehicles in reducing oil imports; (2) provide technical assistance for the deployment of alternative fuel and alternative fueled vehicles and infrastructure; and (3) award grants to provide training and education for vocational workforce development for the manufacture and maintenance of alternative fueled vehicles and the manufacture, installation, support, and inspection of alternative fuel recharging, refueling, and distribution infrastructure.</p> <p>Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to: (1) redefine &quot;idle reduction technology&quot; to include a technology that uses an alternative fuel to reduce consumption of conventional fuel and environmental emissions; and (2) extend appropriations through FY2018 to reduce extended idling from heavy-duty vehicles and locomotives.</p> <p>Requires the Secretary to identify barriers and remedies in electric and natural gas and oil pipeline transmission and distribution systems to the distribution of alternative fuels and the deployment of alternative fuel recharging and refueling capability at economically competitive costs for consumers.</p> <p>Requires the Secretary to establish an interagency coordination council for the development and procurement of alternative fueled vehicles by federal agencies. Requires electricity and natural gas consumed by federal agencies to fuel alternative fueled vehicles to be considered an alternative fuel and accounted for under federal fleet management reporting requirements, rather than under federal building management reporting requirements. </p> <p>Requires the Secretary to assess federal government fleets.</p> <p>Extends states' authority to allow inherently low-emission and energy-efficient vehicles to use high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes. <br> </p>]]></text>
