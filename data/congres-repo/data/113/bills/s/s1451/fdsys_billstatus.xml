Requires the priority of projects included on the list to be based on the best available science and on specified criteria, with preference given to projects that benefit existing neighborhoods in the Basin that are at or below regional median income levels. Requires the list to be revised every two years or on a finding of compelling need justifying a priority shift.</p> <p>Requires the USFWS to deploy strategies consistent with the Lake Tahoe Aquatic Invasive Species Management Plan to prevent the introduction of aquatic invasive species into the Basin. Applies those strategies to all watercraft to be launched on water within the Basin. </p> <p>Authorizes the TRPA to certify state and local agencies to perform decontamination activities at locations outside the Basin if standards at the sites meet or exceed standards for similar sites in the Basin. Authorizes the strategies to be modified if the Secretary of the Interior issues a determination that alternative measures will be no less effective at preventing the introduction of aquatic invasive species into Lake Tahoe. </p> <p>Authorizes the USFWS to collect and spend fees for decontamination only at a level sufficient to cover the costs of operation of inspection and decontamination stations. Sets forth civil penalties for launching watercraft not in compliance with such strategies.</p>  <p>Authorizes the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works to enter into interagency agreements with nonfederal interests in the Basin to use Lake Tahoe Partnership-Miscellaneous General Investigations funds to provide programmatic technical assistance for EIP.</p> <p>Requires the Secretary, the Administrator, the TRPA, California, Nevada, and the Tahoe Science Consortium to implement a Lake Tahoe Basin Science Program that includes: </p> <ul> <li>developing and updating an integrated multiagency programmatic assessment and monitoring plan to evaluate the effectiveness of EIP and the status and trends of indicators related to environmental threshold carrying capacities and to assess the impacts and risks of changing water temperature and precipitation and invasive species; </li> <li>producing and synthesizing scientific information necessary for the identification and refinement of environmental indicators for the Basin and the evaluation of standards and benchmarks; </li> <li>conducting applied research, programmatic technical assessments, scientific data management, analysis, and reporting related to key management questions; </li> <li>developing new tools and information to support objective assessments for land use and resource conditions; </li> <li>providing support to governments in reducing pollutants that contribute to the loss of lake clarity and implementing an integrated stormwater monitoring assessment program; and </li> <li>providing support for the development of management strategies to accommodate changing water temperature and precipitation in the Basin.</li> </ul> <p>Requires the Secretary, Administrator, and Directors to conduct related public education and outreach programs. Requires USGS to provide scientific and technical guidance to the public outreach and education programs.</p> <p>Requires the Secretary to report to Congress on the status of projects authorized by this Act, expenditures to implement EIP and projects authorized under this Act, accomplishments in implementing this Act, and public education and outreach efforts undertaken to implement programs and projects.</p> <p>Requires the President, as part of the annual budget, to submit information regarding each federal agency involved in EIP.</p> <p>(Sec. 9) Authorizes appropriations for such Act for a period of 10 fiscal years beginning the first fiscal year after enactment of this Act.</p> <p>(Sec. 10) Authorizes the Secretary: (1) to accept a donation of approximately 1,981 acres of land administered by the California Tahoe Conservancy and approximately 187 acres of land administered by California State Parks; and (2) after receiving the title to those acres, to convey to California approximately 1,995 acres of Forest Service land.</p>]]></text>
