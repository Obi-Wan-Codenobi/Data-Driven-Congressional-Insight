Requires written notification of the identification of a covered person or entity to the head of an executive agency or the commander of a covered command, who shall then notify the heads of contracting activities or other appropriate officials.</p> <p>Requires the revision of applicable procurement regulations to: (1) authorize the head of contracting activity of an executive agency, upon receiving notice of a covered person or entity, to restrict, terminate, or void the award of contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements that would provide funds to such covered person or entity; (2) require the inclusion of a clause in each covered contract, grant, or cooperative agreement requiring the recipient of funds to exercise due diligence to ensure that funds are not provided to a covered person or entity; and (3) require written notification to a contractor or recipient of a grant or cooperative agreement&nbsp;of an action to restrict, terminate, or void a grant, contract, or cooperative agreement and permit such contractor or recipient to challenge such action by requesting an administrative review.
