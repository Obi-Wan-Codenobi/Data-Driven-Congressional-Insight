Permits the NSF, if it determines that additional test beds are necessary, to award grants to institutions of higher education or research and development nonprofit institutions to establish such additional test beds. </p> <p>Requires the OSTP to coordinate with other ongoing research initiatives. </p> <p>Amends the Cyber Security Research and Development Act to permit NSF research and development grants for: (1) secure fundamental protocols that are integral to inter-network communications and data exchange; (2) secure software engineering and software assurance; (3) holistic system security to address trusted and untrusted components, reduce vulnerabilities proactively, address insider threats, and support privacy; (4) monitoring, detection, mitigation, and rapid recovery methods; and (5) secure wireless networks, mobile devices, and cloud infrastructure. </p> <p>Directs specified agencies under the High-Performance Computing Act of 1991 to support research leading to a scientific foundation for the field of cybersecurity. </p> <p>(Sec. 202) Expands the criteria to be considered by the NSF when evaluating grant applications of institutions seeking to establish Centers for Computer and Network Security Research to include: (1) the applicant's affiliations with private sector entities and existing federal research programs; (2) experience managing public-private partnerships; (3) capabilities to conduct interdisciplinary cybersecurity research in a secure environment; and (4) research in areas such as systems security, wireless security, networking and protocols, formal methods and high-performance computing, nanotechnology, or industrial control systems. </p> <p>(Sec. 203) Revises provisions under the Cyber Security Research and Development Act concerning NIST's development and dissemination of security risk checklists associated with computer systems that are, or are likely to become, widely used within the federal government. </p> <p>Requires NIST to establish priorities for the development, and revision as necessary, of security automation standards, associated reference materials (including protocols), and checklists associated with such systems in order to enable standardized and interoperable technologies, architectures, and frameworks to continuously monitor information security within the federal government. </p> <p>Instructs NIST to ensure that federal agencies are informed of the availability of such standards, reference materials, or checklists. </p> <p>(Sec. 204) Requires NIST to conduct intramural security research activities under its computing standards program. </p> <p><b>Title III: Education and Workforce Development</b> - (Sec. 301) Directs the Department of Commerce, NSF, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to support competitions and challenges to recruit individuals to perform information technology security duties or to stimulate cybersecurity innovations.</p> <p>Authorizes the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to support internships or other work experience in the federal government for the winners of such competitions and challenges.</p> <p>(Sec. 302) Directs NSF to continue the Federal Cyber Scholarship-for-Service program under which recipients agree to work in the cybersecurity mission of a federal, state, local, or tribal agency for a period equal to the length of their scholarship. Limits each scholarship to a maximum of three years. Requires NSF to evaluate and report periodically to Congress on: (1) the success of recruiting individuals for such scholarships, and (2) hiring and retaining those individuals in the public sector workforce.</p> <p><b>Title IV: Cybersecurity Awareness and Preparedness</b> - (Sec. 401) Directs NIST to continue coordinating a national cybersecurity awareness and education program to: (1) disseminate technical standards and make best practices usable by individuals, small to medium-sized businesses, educational institutions, and state, local, and tribal governments; (2) increase public awareness and understanding of cybersecurity; (3) support education programs; and (4) evaluate workforce needs. Requires NIST to develop a strategic plan to guide federal activities in support of such program. Directs NIST to transmit such plan to Congress every five years.</p> <p><b>Title V: Advancement of Cybersecurity Technical Standards</b> - (Sec. 502) Requires NIST to ensure the coordination of federal agencies engaged in the development of international technical standards related to information system security. Requires the development and transmittal to Congress of a plan to ensure coordination by such federal agencies. Instructs NIST to ensure consultation with appropriate private sector stakeholders. </p> <p>(Sec. 503) Requires NIST, in coordination with OMB and in collaboration with the Federal Chief Information Officers Council, to continue to develop and encourage implementation of a comprehensive strategy for the use and adoption of cloud computing services by the federal government. </p> <p>Requires consideration to be given to activities that: (1) accelerate the development, in collaboration with the private sector, of standards that address the interoperability and portability of cloud computing services; (2) advance the development of conformance testing performed by the private sector in support of cloud computing standardization; and (3) support, in consultation with the private sector, the development of appropriate security frameworks and reference materials, and the identification of best practices, for federal agencies to use in addressing security and privacy requirements. </p> <p>(Sec. 504) Requires NIST to continue a program to support the development of voluntary and cost-effective technical standards, metrology, testbeds, and conformance criteria with regard to identity management research and development. </p>]]></text>
