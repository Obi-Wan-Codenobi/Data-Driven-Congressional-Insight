        <text><![CDATA[ <p>Prepare, Ready, Equip, and Prevent Areas at Risk of Emergency Wildfires Act of 2013 or the PREPARE Act of 2013 - Amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to direct the President, acting through the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to establish a pilot program to make grants to states for wildfire mitigation and preparedness.</p> <p>Permits a grant to be used to: (1) reduce the use of fuels that may contribute to catastrophic wildfires in high-risk areas; (2) invest in personnel, organizations, vehicles, and equipment to improve wildfire preparedness; (3) invest in airborne assets to help contain, suppress, and monitor wildfires; and (4) prevent damage from runoff into waterways and floods caused by erosion from wildfires.</p> <p>Makes a state eligible for assistance under this Act if the fire management assistance grant ratio for such state is equal to or greater than 150% of the state population ratio. Authorizes the President to waive that requirement if a state: (1) files a petition for waiver of that requirement, and (2) demonstrates that significant environmental changes or shifts in forest health put the state at an elevated risk for catastrophic wildfires.</p> <p>Allows the governor of a state to award grant funds to: (1) any county or municipality in that state with a community wildfire protection plan or a local mitigation plan, or (2) any other entity that is explicitly referenced in and central to the design of such a plan.</p> <p>Directs the President to consider environmental conditions in a state and give preference to a state: (1) with a high level of need for assistance based on the best scientific data available, (2) a state that provides 100% matching non-federal funds, and (3) a state that previously received a grant and efficiently and effectively used the federal funds for wildfire mitigation and preparedness activities. </p> <p>Directs the President to use specified unobligated amounts in the National Predisaster Mitigation Fund for each of FY2014-FY2019 in carrying out this Act.</p>]]></text>
