        <text><![CDATA[ <p>Contracting and Tax Accountability Act of 2014 - Requires the head of any executive agency that issues an invitation for bids or a request for proposals for a contract, or that offers a grant, in an amount greater than the simplified acquisition threshold, to require each person submitting a bid or proposal or grant application to submit a form: (1) certifying whether the person has a seriously delinquent tax debt, and (2) authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to disclose information limited to describing whether such person has such a debt. </p> <p>Subjects a person who submits a certification that he or she has a seriously delinquent tax debt, or whose certification that he or she does not have such a debt is demonstrated to be false, to a negative responsibility determination when applying for a federal contract or grant. Provides for: (1) the suspension from the federal procurement process of a person who certifies that he or she has such a debt, and (2) debarment of a person whose certification that he or she does not have such a debt is demonstrated to be false.</p> <p>Defines "seriously delinquent tax debt" as an outstanding tax debt for which a notice of lien has been filed in public records. Exempts from such definition: (1) tax debts that are being paid in a timely manner under an approved installment agreement, and (2) debts for which a collection due process hearing has been requested or is pending. </p>]]></text>
