Expands services to caregivers of veterans under such program to include&nbsp;child care services, financial planning services, and legal services. </p> <p>Authorizes the transfer of entitlement to post 9/11 education assistance to family members by veterans who are retired for a physical disability or&nbsp;who are seriously injured veterans in need of family caregiver services, without regard to length-of-service requirements. </p> <p>Authorizes the VA Secretary to pay monthly special compensation to seriously injured or ill veterans in need of personal care services and to their caregivers. Excludes from gross income, for income tax purposes, such compensation paid to injured or ill veterans. </p> <p>Authorizes&nbsp;flexible work schedules or telework&nbsp;for federal employees who are caregivers of veterans. </p> <p>Amends the Public Health Service Act to&nbsp;designate a veteran participating in the program of comprehensive assistance for family caregivers as an adult with a special need for purposes of the&nbsp;lifespan respite care program. </p> <p>Establishes in the executive branch an interagency working group to review and report on policies relating to the caregivers of veterans and members of the Armed Forces.</p> <p>Directs the Secretary to provide for studies on members of the Armed Forces who commenced service after September 11, 2001, and veterans who have incurred a serious injury or illness, including a mental health injury, and their caregivers. </p>]]></text>
