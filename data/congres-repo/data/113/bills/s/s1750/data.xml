  <summary date="2015-03-19T19:43:10Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Public Access to Public Land Guarantee Act - Directs the Department of the Interior or the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to enter into an agreement under which they may accept funds from the state or local government to reopen units of the National Park System, the National Wildlife Refuge System, or the National Forest System during any period in which Interior or USDA is unable to maintain normal level of operations at their units because of a lapse in appropriations.

Requires Interior or USDA, as appropriate, to refund all amounts it provided under the agreement to the state or local government: (1) upon enactment of an Act retroactively appropriating amounts sufficient to maintain normal operating levels at the reopened units, or (2) on the date on which the state or local government establishes that Interior or USDA collected entrance or user fees for the units during the agreement period.

Allows Interior or USDA to reimburse the state or local government voluntarily for any amounts it provided to the United States under the agreement if the refund requirements are not met.</summary>
