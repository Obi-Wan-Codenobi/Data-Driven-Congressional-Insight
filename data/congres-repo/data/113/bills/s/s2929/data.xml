Precludes such new balancing authority from taking effect until approved by FERC.

Requires FERC to publish a cost-benefit analysis of the proposed NAERC decision, including its likely financial impact upon ratepayers, before issuing a decision to approve, disapprove, or modify the NAERC decision.</summary>
